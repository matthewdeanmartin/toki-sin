Ideas about a new simple language


It is possible to develop a language that is simpler than Esperanto and Toki Pona and yet can serve for simple communication?

The number of words should be limited to less than 500. More like even less.

To develop this language, it should be done from the beginning and synchronously with one (or more) parser. This can be done in prolog and/or another programming language. Only sentences that pass the parser test are correct sentences.

We could also go the other way: have a semantic representation and parse/generate between that and the language. Eg Conceptual Dependency theory.

We use different ways to build this language. In the first phase we can adopt words and some grammar from Toki Pona. We should compile what are the advantages and disadvantages of Toki Pona (or Esperanto).

The grammar has to be simpler than Toki Pona. 

Fixed constituent order SVO, simple sentences only.

How about ‘sama’ for ‘to be’? “waso li sama lili” meaning “the bird is small”?
